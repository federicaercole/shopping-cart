# Shopping Cart
A fake online store done in React, a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-shopping-cart).  
[Live version](https://federicaercole.github.io/shopping-cart/)

## Features:
- Product search
- Cart Management
- Breadcrumbs
- Show products by category, sorting by alphabetical order or price
- Accessible galleries

![Form validation example](https://federicaercole.com/images/shop/validation.mp4)
The form validation uses a "Reward Early, Punish Late" pattern, which consists of alerting the user when there are any errors within the input in the moment they leave the input and removing the error message immediately if they correct the input.

![Focus trap on modal](https://federicaercole.com/images/shop/focus-trap.mp4)
An example of accessible gallery: the focus stays "trapped" in the modal dialog.
